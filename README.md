# when2meet-highlighter
Chrome Extension that allows users to visually see the indiviudal availability of people on the when2meet web app (https://www.when2meet.com).

This is extremely useful if you have a single person that has to be at a meeting (regardless of how many other people can show).

## Instructions
Install the Chrome Extension. The names of all the participants should appear at the bottom. Selecting any name should tint all the times that person is available.
